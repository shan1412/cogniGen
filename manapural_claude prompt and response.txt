"section": "Historical Context",
"content": "When speaking of gold, India is often mentioned as holding the worlds' largest stock of privately held gold with estimates ranging from 20 to 25,000 tonnes. Along with China, India is the largest consumer of gold and accounted for 23 percent of global demand between 2009-2018. Further, its physical stock Is supplemented every year by the largest import of gold, averaging about 700 to 800 tonnes per annum. Historically, Indians have for ages had a particular affinity for gold. Gold jewellery takes pride of place in social and cultural occasions, and there is an emotional attachment to family gold jewellery, which often gets passed on from one generation to another. Not surprisingly, rural India holds the bulk of India's gold estimated at 60 to 65 percent of the total gold and 2/3rds of aggregate demand for gold comes from rural areas. What is more, gold in the Indian household usually belongs to the women (referred to as 'Stridhana') and thus a source of empowerment for them. Lacking access to formal financial institutions (the banking network has limited reach in rural areas), gold is the preferred outlet for parking household savings in times of surplus. In times of need, gold is pledged to draw money. This is the origin of the age-old business of pawnbroking or lending against used household gold jewellery.",

"section": "Historical Context",
"content": "In India, the business of lending against gold jewellery has existed for ages. Initially the preserve of the ubiquitous small-time pawnbrokers and moneylenders, the last two decades have seen larger organised players make significant inroads. Why did the gold loans business evolve so well in India but no much in other countries? The answer has to do with idea of 'bullion plus.' Strictly speaking, lending against used household jewellery takes into account the value of the bullion content of the jewellery. However, the emotional connect that borrowers have with the jewellery works as an additional cushion for the lender, making the business of lending against gold jewellery different from, and more secure, than any ordinary kind of commodity lending. Besides, the lender also has the cushion of the making cost of the jewellery which is not financed. This explains why India is an especially fertile ground for gold loans with few parallels elsewhere.",

This is partly due to the fact that organised players were relatively late entrants and they could make an impact only in the last two decades with the rise of gold-loan focussed non-banks. Also, with the bulk of gold being held in rural areas, beyond the reach of the banking network, moneylenders and pawnbrokers operating in lanes and by-lanes could remain in business and flourish. However, with developments in recent years such as Demonetisation (2016) and the nation-wide rollout of GST (2017) hastening the pace of formalisation of India's economy, organised sector gold loan players have a better opportunity to grow business by taking market share away from unorganised players.",

The appetite for risk and disbursing new loans falls. At this point, gold loans become the natural fall-back for borrowers denied access to their regular channels, and this new demand more than compensates for the loss of demand from traditional sources.

Further, the tendency among governments and central banks to respond to such crises by easy money policies and fiscal stimulus drives gold prices higher. In India, where the gold prices depend on the international price as well as the USD/ INR exchange rate, the rupee is generally seen to depreciate during crisis periods when a risk-off phase leads to withdrawal of foreign portfolio investments. Given this natural impetus towards higher gold prices, it becomes an additional boost for the gold loans business.

And that was how, during the Global Financial Crisis of 2008-09, Manappuram Finance Ltd. (at the time, the only listed gold loan company in India) was able to record uninterrupted growth and profitability during this period. Sequoia Capital, one of the first PE investors in the company (in 2007, just before the meltdown), was able to exit in 2010 having grown their investment five-fold.",

With banks becoming wary of lending further to NBFCs, liquidity dried up, and it was soon revealed that many prominent NBFCs were facing acute ALM mismatches. The outlook for NBFCs had suddenly darkened and share prices of NBFCs across the sector suffered severe erosion. However, it was not long before the market woke up to the fact that NBFCs focussed on gold loans dealt predominantly in short term loans and therefore comfortably placed in respect of ALM. Once this realisation came about, the shares of these companies recovered and outperformed the market.",

However, compared to the banks, the focussed non-banks are better placed here because their low-cost model makes it easier to open new branches in rural and semi-urban areas. Since banks have much higher operating cost, they would hesitate to venture in these parts given the limited potential for other business.

Another key demand driver of gold loan is that as income levels go up, the value that people attribute to their time goes up, and this increases the demand for gold loans (which can be availed instantaneously with minimum hassles) for meeting short term, small ticket needs. Put another way, the opportunity cost of alternative sources of finance (involving multiple visits to branches, considerable effort and time in compiling required documentation, etc.) increases.",

"content": "Short-term gold loans

Traditionally, gold loans were sanctioned for a tenure of one year, and borrowers were allowed to make bullet payments of interest and principal. This makes it very flexible for the borrower. However, the downside of this became visible in 2013 when a sudden and sharp correction in gold prices led to higher defaults and credit losses. In response, the industry as-a-whole shifted to periodic (monthly) collection of interest to preserve its lending margins. However,

Manappuram Finance decided to break from convention and went further to launch short term gold loan products, mainly of three and six months tenure. Over the years since, the company has succeeded in shifting the bulk of its gold loans to the short-term buckets, which minimises the price risk. The changeover had to be managed carefully, and customers were educated about the advantages of renewing the loan every three months as against the risk of having compounding interest pile up over a year.

The rationale for short-term loan

To arrest volatility from adverse gold price movement as gold loan remains in-the-money

To curb delinquencies and write-offs therefrom

To bring down variations in yield on portfolio

To lower accrued interest

4. 'Increases customer stickiness as they do not have to visit the branch for disbursal or interest payment' – implies an increase in customer loyalty or retention because of the convenience of no longer needing to physically visit a branch for transactions related to loans.

Overall, the image conveys a sense of process optimization and customer convenience in a financial context, specifically related to online gold loan processing.",

"content": "Notwithstanding its comfortable ALM position, the company has proactively sought to increase the share of long-term funds in its funding mix and achieved remarkable success. In March 2019, India's premier lending institution, NABARD, sanctioned a term loan of Rs. 7,700 million meant to be deployed for onward lending to the MSME and microfinance sectors. In June 2019, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a subsidiary of World Bank, sanctioned a 3-year term loan of US$75 million, the first-ever external commercial borrowing (ECB) availed by the company. This was IFC's very first gold loan focused investment. In January 2020, the company raised US$300 million by way of senior secured fixed rate notes issuance for a three-year tenor. The issue was placed with a coupon of 5.90 per cent and was the first such issuance by the company in the global bond market, tapping investors in Asia and Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA). While long term funds come at a higher cost, it imparts stability to the company's funding sources and is therefore considered worthwhile. Besides, gold loans being small ticket and short-term loans, it is easier to pass on an increase in the cost of funds, should this become necessary.",

"content": "The image shows a bubble timeline chart plotting data points over time. The horizontal axis represents time with dates formatted as dd-mm-yyyy, ranging from early 2019 to early 2020. The vertical axis has numerical values that range from 5 to 9.5.

Data points are represented by circles, or 'bubbles,' where the size of each bubble could imply a quantitative value such as frequency, amount, or another dimension of the data. The vertical position of each bubble corresponds to a value on the vertical axis, indicating that the data value varies over time.

There are clusters of bubbles concentrated around certain time intervals, with a noticeable pattern where larger bubbles are clustered within specific periods, perhaps indicating higher activity or another measure during these times. 

Overall, without context, it's unclear what these data points represent, but the chart could be used to visualize trends, patterns, or anomalies in a dataset over a given timeframe.

The short-term nature of loans reduces the likelihood of unpaid interest compounding to unmanageable levels and has helped reduce overall auction percentages.
